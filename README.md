## Development setup

Built with:

Vite was chosen because it is lightweight. This is not a React app, but making it a vanilla Vite project made deploying via Dokku much simpler.

If you want to play around with the code, clone this repo and run these commands to get it going locally:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The terminal should tell you which port it's on.
